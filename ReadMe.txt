Hello, 

I used T-SQL for this task.

## Initial task notes
SP_IMPORT_JSON_FILES:  

I unzipped json files manually. I couldn't find a solution to do this using SQL. 
To run this procedure you just need to change the path of json files at line 70.
All required tables will be created automatically. 
Duplication is checked in the procedure.
Print screen of tables are included in the file.

## Extension task notes
SP_RETAILER_STATISTICS:  

This procedure will show summary statistics for each retailer and each week of November.
All required tables will be created automatically. 
Duplication is checked in the procedure.
I also extract the output in an excel file.
Print screen of the table is included in the file.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
